# Sorry, we can't mention line number as ipynb files runs as block. So, For each team member we have questions solved in same sequence as questions and for each problem we have written name before it. 

Folder structure - The main is "app" folder which have all files inside it. app.py is the main script file for running the webapp. Main.ipynb file contains the code for Data training and model evaluation.
app ----> app.py(source file)
    ----> Main.ipynb(file for data cleaning, processing,model training,EDA analysys)
    ----> Data_Files(containes unstructured data)
    ----> 4 pickle files for model prediction(considering 4 problems)
    ----> readme.md
    ----> cleaned dataset and structured data set files
